            </p>
            <p>
              Processing of such information may include collecting, storing, using, sharing, transferring, and disclosing information, all of which activities shall take place in India.

              You further expressly authorise TutorExel to contact you through calls, SMS, email, WhatsApp, and platform notifications for providing Services and for sharing information about existing or new offerings, and such consent shall override any registration under NDNC or DND regulations, to the extent permitted by law.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, certain areas of the Site or Applications, or certain Services, may be subject to additional terms, guidelines, or policies.

            <h2>Platform Nature</h2>
            <p>
              The Site, Applications, and Services together comprise an online educational platform through which Students may learn about and enrol in Courses offered directly by TutorExel.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel may rely on third-party platforms including video-conferencing tools, learning management systems, payment gateways, and communication services.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel does not control and shall not be liable for outages, data loss, security breaches, or service interruptions attributable to such third-party platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel provides the Courses end-to-end and is not responsible for compliance by Members with any agreements with third parties, or with laws and regulations outside TutorExel&apos;s reasonable control. TutorExel reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to suspend or disable access to the Site, Applications, or Services for any reason it considers objectionable, unlawful, or in violation of these Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Use of the Site, Applications, and Services is available only to persons who can form legally binding contracts under Indian law.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Services are intended solely for Students below eighteen (18) years of age, who must be enrolled exclusively by their Parent or legal Guardian. Any access or use of the Site, Applications, or Services by a minor without valid parental authorisation is expressly prohibited.

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              By accessing or using the Site, Applications, or Services, the Parent or Guardian represents and warrants that they are legally competent and authorised to accept these Terms on behalf of the Student.
            </p>

            <h2>Usage of Site, Applications, or Services</h2>
            <p>
              The Site, Applications, and Services may be used to facilitate enrolment in Courses offered by TutorExel. You may browse the Site as an unregistered visitor; however, to enrol in any Course or access restricted features, you must register and create a TutorExel account.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel&apos;s responsibilities are limited to making the Courses available through the Site and Applications, unless expressly stated otherwise.
            </p>

            <h2>Account Registration</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
              Courses may be offered through TutorExel&apos;s own platform or through third-party learning management systems and video-conferencing tools selected by TutorExel. TutorExel reserves the right to modify Course structure, schedules, content, instructors, or delivery mechanisms at its discretion for academic, operational, or technical reasons, without creating any entitlement to refund except as expressly stated in the applicable refund policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel does not assume responsibility for a Student&apos;s compliance with obligations imposed by third parties, including internet service providers, hardware or software vendors, or external platforms used to access the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel further reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to suspend or disable access to the Platform or Services for any Student or Member whose conduct is deemed objectionable, unlawful, disruptive, or in violation of these Terms or TutorExel&apos;s internal standards.
            </p>

            <h2>Instructor Relationship and Independent Status</h2>
            <p>
              All instructors engaged by TutorExel for the delivery of Courses are engaged as independent contractors or service providers. Nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to create an employer-employee relationship, agency, partnership, joint venture, or fiduciary relationship between TutorExel and any instructor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instructors act exclusively on their own behalf and not as agents of TutorExel. TutorExel does not control instructors&apos; conduct outside the scope of delivering online classes through the Platform and shall not be responsible for any offline or unauthorised interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instructors are expressly prohibited from representing themselves as partners, agents, or authorised representatives of TutorExel beyond the scope of Services delivered through the Platform, or from using TutorExel&apos;s intellectual property without authorisation.
            </p>

            <h2>Enrolment Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              When enrolling in a Course, the Parent or Guardian may be required to provide or verify certain information, including contact details, Student details, and platform access credentials. Failure to provide accurate or complete information may result in delay, suspension, or cancellation of enrolment.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel reserves the right to deny or cancel enrolment where eligibility requirements are not met or where enrolment information is found to be inaccurate or misleading.
            </p>

            <h2>No Endorsement</h2>
            <p>
              By using the Site, Applications, or Services, you acknowledge and agree that TutorExel does not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the actions or omissions of any other Member, Student, instructor, or third party.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any legal remedy or liability arising from the actions or omissions of other Members or third parties shall be limited solely to a claim against the person or entity responsible for such actions or omissions. You expressly agree not to seek to impose liability on TutorExel for such matters.
            </p>

            <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              If an enrolment request is made for any Course through the Site, Applications, or otherwise communicated channels, TutorExel shall either confirm, reject, or place such request on hold within a reasonable period. Where enrolment is not confirmed, any amount collected shall be refunded in accordance with TutorExel&apos;s Refund and Cancellation Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Course Fees payable shall be clearly communicated to the Parent or Guardian prior to enrolment confirmation. TutorExel may collect Course Fees on a monthly subscription basis, one-time basis, or otherwise as specified for the relevant Course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payments may be made through authorised payment gateways such as Razorpay or through direct bank transfer as specified on the invoice. TutorExel does not store or process card or banking credentials directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Access to Courses, recorded sessions, learning materials, or platform credentials shall be provided only after successful receipt and verification of payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel reserves the right to suspend or restrict access to Services where payments are reversed, disputed, delayed, or charged back.
            </p>

            <h2>Invoices and Taxes</h2>
            <p>
              TutorExel shall issue system-generated invoices for Course Fees paid, inclusive of applicable Taxes, in accordance with Indian law. Parents or Guardians are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of billing details provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any statutory taxes, including goods and services tax (GST), shall be levied as applicable at the prevailing rates.
            </p>

            <h2>Payment Confirmation</h2>
            <p>
              Upon successful confirmation of enrolment and receipt of payment, TutorExel shall issue a confirmation through email, WhatsApp, or platform notification summarising the enrolment details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Access to the Platform and Services shall be provided only after successful verification of payment.
            </p>

            <h2>Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              All refunds, cancellations, and withdrawals are governed strictly by TutorExel&apos;s Refund and Cancellation Policy, which forms an integral part of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              No oral representations, messages, or assurances made by sales, academic, or support staff shall modify or override the written refund policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              If, as a Student (through the Parent or Guardian), you wish to cancel a confirmed enrolment made through the Site, Applications, or Services after enrolment in a Course, the cancellation and refund policy applicable to such Course shall apply. No refund shall be made in respect of any classes, sessions, or learning material already provided or accessed.
            </p>
            <p>
              TutorExel&apos;s ability to refund Course Fees or any other amounts charged shall depend strictly upon the terms of the applicable Refund and Cancellation Policy, the nature of the Course (live classes, co-curricular activities, NAPLAN bootcamp live, or NAPLAN self-study), and the stage at which cancellation is requested. Details regarding refunds and cancellations are made available on the Site, Applications, or through official communication channels, and Parents or Guardians are advised to review the same carefully before enrolment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any refunds determined to be eligible shall be initiated by TutorExel in accordance with its payment processing timelines and methods. TutorExel does not guarantee immediate processing of refunds and shall not be responsible for delays caused by banking systems, payment gateways, or third-party processors.
            </p>
            <p>
              If TutorExel cancels a confirmed enrolment for any Course, TutorExel shall refund the Course Fees paid for such enrolment, subject to verification and adjustment, and such refund shall not exceed the total amount actually paid by the Parent or Guardian for the relevant Course.
            </p>

            <h2>Taxes</h2>
            <p>
              You understand and acknowledge that applicable governmental authorities may require TutorExel to collect Taxes on the Course Fees paid for Services and remit such Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tax laws and requirements may vary based on jurisdiction, and such Taxes may be levied as a percentage of the Course Fees or otherwise as required under applicable law. All Course Fees displayed or communicated may be exclusive or inclusive of Taxes as specified, and any applicable Taxes shall be borne by the Parent or Guardian.
            </p>
